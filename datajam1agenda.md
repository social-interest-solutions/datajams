Intro
Telling stories with data is hard to do. It relies on a diverse set of skills - data processing, graphic design, storytelling, and more. This activity helps you build those skills by taking apart work that others have done (the good and the bad) to build your critical eye.
We'll break down and discuss a four things about a visualization -
(1) the data it uses,
(2) the ways it shows that data,
(3) the narrative it is trying to tell, and (4) evaluating whether it combines those to tell the data story well.

Give participants just a minute or two to review the handout together.

Exploratory questions!
*Identify some of the datasets used. Collect four or five answers from participant. For the USAID graphic, these often include answers like "population data over time", "crop yield predictions", and "animal ownership in Ecuador".
Then talk about how telling these stories requires you to pull from multiple datasets; you can seldom put together a strong story with just one spreadsheet.

How this data is represented. Collect a few answers. For example, in the USAID graphic population size is represented by a globe increasing in size and percentages are represented as donut charts.
Briefly share how this sets up a consistent set of charts and symbols and ways to use them. We call this the **"visual vocabulary"** of the story.

Thirdly, ask participants to identify the short story they think this graphic is trying to tell. What are the data and visual representation trying to say? Ask folks to summarize it in just one sentence, like you would in a tweet. In the USAID example most people think the story is something like "food needs are rising, and if we can help female farmers we'd be better prepared to produce enough food." Try to keep participants focused on the story, rather than what they think about it (that comes next).

To finish, ask folks if they think the story is well told.
*What elements best support the story? Are there extraneous pieces that don't help the story along?
*Are there pieces that actively distract from the main point or contradict it?
*In the USAID example focus on the takeaway message - what is it? Is it emphasized enough? Does it solve the problem? Emphasize that telling these stories has to focus on a main point, and everything needs to support it. Even if there is some cool data that you want to include, you need to make sure it supports the main story, otherwise it will just distract. Are there examples of data that could be removed from the USAID story to make it more effective?

# Sculptures
The playful approach to the data helps engage the participants in thinking about how stories can be found and presented quickly, and helps people feel more freedom and flexibility about data presentations. It builds a notion of "presentation" instead of "visualization".

Show Data charts

Ask the group to pair up, preferably with someone they donâ€™t know. Show participants a large central table full of the materials you have gathered. Give them 6 minutes to quickly build a physical representation of the data you presented earlier.

DO NOT: Pens, markers and pipe cleaner bar charts are NOT allowed!

At 3m remind them they should be building now! 6m total!

Have each group report out, 1m each.

Then pick a new dataset to use.

Repeat
